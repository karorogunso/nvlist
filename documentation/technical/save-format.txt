NVList 3 used a custom binary format for its save files, with a chunk system similar to that used by PNG. NVList 4 uses ZIP-archive based format, replacing the chunks with file entries in a ZIP archive.

*** Format ***

- header.xml
  - File format version
  - Timestamp
  - Userdata
    Custom key/value properties that scripts can use to store additional data
  - Thumbnail
    An image (screenshot) representing the saved data. The header contains information about the size of the image, while the image data is stored as a separate file.
- thumbnail.jpg
  Thumbnail image data.
- savedata.bin
  Serialized form of the engine state. This type of save data is very sensitive against changes in the engine and/or game script.
