    <section title="Detecting Android" level="2">
      <p>The <code>android</code> global variable is set to <code>true</code> when running on the Android version of NVList.</p>
    </section>
    <section title="Text Rendering" level="2">
      <p>Text rendering between the desktop and Android versions of NVList are different on a fundamental level. Desktop NVList renders text to the screen one character at a time, while the Android version draws an entire paragraph to a texture and renders that. Also, the Android version renders text at the screen's native resolution for increased sharpness.</p>
      <p>In most cases it's better to disable custom textboxes when running on Android. The system resizes/positions the textbox on Android based on user preferences, so any custom textbox would need to handle this dynamic positioning (the built-in <code>customTextBox</code> function doesn't).</p>

    <section title="Save Screen" level="2">
      <p>Android will default to using its own save/load screens.</p>
    </section>
    <section title="Shaders" level="2">
      <p>The Android build uses OpenGL-ES 2.0 which isn't compatible with desktop OpenGL. If you want your custom shaders to work on Android, you'll need to provide OpenGL ES 2.0 compatible implementations in <code>res/shader-es2</code>.</p>

    <section title="Minor Issues" level="2">
      <ul>
        <li>KTX image format not supported.</li>
        <li>Theora video isn't supported on all devices (but you can use other video formats).</li>
        <li>Textures may use a lower bit-depth (RGBA8888, RGB565) for performance/compatibility.</li>
