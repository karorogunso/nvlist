    <p>NVList comes with an optional bug/typo reporting mode specifically made for proofreaders and beta testers. To activate this special mode, turn on <code>enableProofreaderTools</code> from within Build.jar and do a rebuild. This adds a conspicuous yellow button to the menu bar which, when pressed, opens a popup window where the user can enter a comment. The entered comment is appended to some automatically collected information (current Lua stack trace, visible text, etc.) and added to <code>save/bugreport.log</code>.</p>
    <p>This systems allows proofreaders to supply comments in the most efficient way possible, while simultaneously collecting considerably more detailed information of the bug/typo location in the script.</p>

    <p>When an exception is raised inside engine code, an error dialogue pops up giving the user the opportunity to report/ignore the error or quit the program. The default behavior of the error report function is to gather the error logs in a .zip and save the file somewhere on the user's machine. If you have a webserver, it's also possible to make the report button <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POST_%28HTTP%29">POST</a> the generated .zip directly to an URL of your choosing â€” just change the value of the <code>errorReportURL</code> preference.</p>
